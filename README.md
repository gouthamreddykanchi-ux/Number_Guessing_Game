📜 How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100.
3. You enter guesses one by one.
4. After each guess, you’ll get feedback:
   - **Too low! 📉** – Your guess is smaller than the magic number.
   - **Too high! 📈** – Your guess is greater than the magic number.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number. 🎯
